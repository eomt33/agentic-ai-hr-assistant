    "This notebook outlines the process of building an AI‑powered HR assistant using OpenAI's language model and vector similarity search. By loading and chunking a policy PDF, generating embeddings, building a FAISS index, and querying GPT‑3.5 through LangChain, we can answer questions grounded in the original document. Optionally, the solution can be wrapped in a Gradio interface for an accessible end‑user experience. Make sure to replace the API key and file paths as needed when running the notebook on your own machine."
