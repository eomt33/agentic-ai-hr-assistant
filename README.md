# Agentic AI HR Assistant (RAG-Based System)

## Overview
This project implements an agentic AI HR assistant that answers HR-related questions using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The system retrieves relevant policy sections from internal documents and generates grounded, explainable responses suitable for compliance-sensitive environments.

## Key Contributions
- Retrieval-augmented question answering over policy documents
- Similarity-based evidence grounding for explainability
- Human-centered decision support design
