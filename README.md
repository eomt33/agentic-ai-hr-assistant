# Agentic AI HR Assistant (RAG-Based System)

## Overview
This project implements an agentic AI HR assistant that answers HR-related questions using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The system retrieves relevant policy sections from internal documents and generates grounded, explainable responses.

## Research & Technical Focus
- Applied NLP for policy and compliance contexts
- Explainable AI through similarity scoring
- Human-centered decision support systems

## Methods
- Document chunking and vector indexing
- Cosine similarity–based retrieval
- Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib)
- Modular pipeline design for auditability

## Outputs
- Interactive HR chatbot interface
- Similarity score visualization across document sections
- Technical report detailing system design and evaluation

## Why This Matters
This system mirrors real-world applications in:
- Institutional compliance
- Clinical research operations
- Policy analysis and decision support

## Artifacts
- Jupyter notebook: `AI_HR_Assistant_Project.ipynb`
- Technical report: `HR_Chatbot_Report.pdf`
